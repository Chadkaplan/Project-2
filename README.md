# INTRO
Name That Baby! is an application created for parents that will assist with randomly selecting names for their new born baby.  The mission statement is to provide a tool for parents that will greatly decrease the stress of naming a child.  There is a lot that a parent has to do to prepare for the coming of a child and 'Name That Baby' will help eliminate "Naming a Child" from that long list of 'To Do's'.  

# HOW TO USE
Name That Baby! will have three simple options on the homepage.  The homepage is the page that greets the user when they navigate to our web based application. The three options are simply: 

  1. What is the gender of your newborn baby (Some of you do not want to know the gender so we provide nuetral option in addition to      boy/girl).
  2. Within what ethnicity would you like to look through (This is one of the highest search parameters in name searching so we included this. 
  3. What letters would you like the name to behind with (This is also a huge search parameter). 

After you have made your selections, you click on a submit button and the application will search and display a list of names. 

# Added Features
We will be working on the following features after we release the MVP.  

  1. Meaning of names
  2. Specific Origins of Names. 
  3. Special Name Combination feature that will allow you to combine names (Ex. Brandgelina).
